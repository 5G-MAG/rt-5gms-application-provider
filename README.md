# 5GMS Application Function Management UI
M1 Client tool user interface has been built as graphical extension for 5GMS reference tool (RT) [**Application Function** (AF)](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function) which represents network component that operates in accordance with another RT [**Application Server** (AS)](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-server), enriching entire [**5GMAGs**](https://github.com/5G-MAG) platform with network functionalities such are provisioning session, content hosting configuration, consumetrics reporting etc. The user interface represent graphical layer on top of existing M1 interface (which establish communication between 5GMs application provider and AF), and it operates as [M1 CLI testing tool](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function/wiki/Testing-the-M1-Interface-on-v1.3.0) but in meticulous, smooth and user-friendy way.
