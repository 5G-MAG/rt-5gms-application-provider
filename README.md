# 5G Reference Tools - 5GMS Application Function Management UI
M1 Client tool user interface is build as graphical extension for 5GMS reference tool (RT) [**Application Function** (AF)](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function). It represent network component that operates in accordance with another RT [**Application Server** (AS)](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-server), enriching entire [5GMAGs](https://github.com/5G-MAG) platform with network functionalities such are provisioning session, content hosting configuration, consumetrics reporting etc. The user interface has been developed as layer on top of existing M1 interface (which establish communication between 5GMs application provider and AF), and it shows [M1 CLI testing tool](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function/wiki/Testing-the-M1-Interface-on-v1.3.0) in meticulous, smooth and user-friendy way.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, you must have installed before mentioned RTs. Please follow the provided guides to install components properly:
- [Application Function](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function/wiki/Testing-as-a-Local-User) (recommended installation as local user)
- [Application Server](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-server/wiki/Development-and-Testing#build-and-install-the-5gms-application-server) (recommended installation as system service). Be aware which versions are required for setup (time sensitive!). 

3Ô∏è‚É£ After installation is completed, run both components in separate terminals:

`sudo 5gms-application-server`

`~/rt-5gms-application-function/install/bin/open5gs-msafd`

## üöÄ Running

Once both RTs are running flawlessly, install requirements:
